# MAP_Hardware

This repository contains hardware-related projects developed as part of the MAP (Microcontroller Applications Project) course. The projects focus on designing and implementing hardware solutions using microcontrollers and related components.

## Projects

### 1. DWI_Hardware_Bin

This project involves the development of a smart waste bin system. The system utilizes sensors and microcontrollers to detect waste levels and manage waste disposal efficiently.

**Features:**

- Automatic lid opening and closing
- Waste level detection
- Notifications for waste collection

**Components Used:**

- Ultrasonic sensors
- Servo motors
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Assemble the hardware components as per the circuit diagram provided in the `DWI_Hardware_Bin` directory.
2. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the system and test the functionality.

### 2. DWI_Hardware_LEDStrip

This project focuses on controlling an LED strip using a microcontroller. The system allows for various lighting effects and patterns to be displayed on the LED strip.

**Features:**

- Multiple lighting patterns
- Brightness control
- Color customization

**Components Used:**

- Addressable LED strip (e.g., WS2812)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Power supply

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Connect the LED strip to the microcontroller as per the wiring diagram in the `DWI_Hardware_LEDStrip` directory.
2. Upload the control code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the system and select the desired lighting pattern.
